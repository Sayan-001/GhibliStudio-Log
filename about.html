                Studio Ghibli, Inc.(Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Kabushiki gaisha Sutajio Jiburi) is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei,
                Tokyo. It has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include 
                various media formats, such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. 
                Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. The mascot, and 
                most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (tanuki) and 
                cats from the 1988 anime film My Neighbor Totoro. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are Spirited Away (2001), 
                Howl's Moving Castle (2004), and Ponyo (2008). Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the 
                irectors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. 
                e studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.

                    and Princess Mononoke is fourth, grossing 20.18 billion yen. Many of their works have won the 
                    Animage Grand Prix award. Four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. 
                    Five of their films have received Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the 2002 Golden Bear 
                    and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

                    Studio Ghibli films are mostly hand-drawn using rich water and acrylic paints. The films use traditional
                    methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques 
                    are used sparingly. All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors, and have a "whimsical and 
                    joyful aesthetic". Studio Ghibli’s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of 
                    undertones on the background and nature in the scene.
                    The films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed 
                    by progress to tradition,[132] environmentalism and the natural world, independent female protagonists,
                    the cost of war, and youth.
